To take NNs to the next level, we need grassroots change: the development of technology that enables neural computing at hardware level.

In order to embrace the neural approach to computing, both theoretical and technological advancements are required. 

The objective is to emulate the architecture of natural neural networks, implementing "electronic" neurons: axons, synapses, dendrites, soma.

This requires a series of paradigm shifts, across different abstraction levels. The overall tendency is allowing for non-binary problem solving and event-driven processing: the solution is identified inside of a spectrum, and the actual processing of data is executed only at the rising front of new information.

This implies a significant change, coming from discrete, synchronous computers.
