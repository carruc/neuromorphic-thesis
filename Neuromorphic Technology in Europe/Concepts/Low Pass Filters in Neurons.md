Offers integration functionalities: $\frac{1}{jwc}$

At low frequencies, the capacitive reactance tends to become infinite and at high frequencies the reactance becomes zero. Hence at low frequencies, the LPF has finite output and at high frequencies the output is nil, which is same for an integrator circuit.

For the LPF to behave as an integrator: $$\tau \ > T$$ with: $$\tau = RC$$![[LPF.png]]
Hence a LPF with large time constant produces an output that is proportional to the integral of an input.
