Measures and fires a spike in front of a certain quantity information. 

This afferent information is processed by neurons through synaptic integration, which is an important information processing mechanism in biological neural networks. 

Synaptic currents integrated ([[Low Pass Filters in Neurons]]) from spiking trains of presynaptic neurons have complex nonlinear dynamics which endow neurons with significant computational abilities. However, in many computational studies of neural networks, external input currents are often simply taken as a direct current that is static.
