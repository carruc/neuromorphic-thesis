Information is usually stored in steady state circuits. Neurons, on the other hand are:
1. *non-linear oscillators* that work in voltage spikes, that are 
2. coupled to each other and 
3. are able to show collective behavior like:
	- [[Synchronization]];
	- [[Transient Dynamics]];
	- [[Edge of Chaos]];
