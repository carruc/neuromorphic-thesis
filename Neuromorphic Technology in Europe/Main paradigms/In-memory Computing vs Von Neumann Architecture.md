The Von Neumann bottleneck implies energy consumption and delays in the physical transfer of information between memory and computing parts.

NNs models run on billions of parameters: how can we store and frequently retrieve those in an efficient way?

The neural approach would require computation and memory to become intricately interwoven, like neurons and synapses and network topology.
