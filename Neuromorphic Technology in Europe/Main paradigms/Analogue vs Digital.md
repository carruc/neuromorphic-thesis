Electrical potential stored in neural membranes and synaptic weights work with continuous values, while computers work in discrete, binary values.

We're currently able to emulate this on a small scale, using analogue components: CMOS and state-of-the-art nanodevices.

This is a crucial step towards energy efficient neural capabilities, but large scale applications are still to be demonstrated.
