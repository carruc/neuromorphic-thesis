Learning is the result of the repeated modification of synapses, until there are enough connections for the brain to perform a certain task accurately.

NNs currently do this explicitly modifying weights; the neuromorphic approach would move the task to a lower level: self-modification of weights through local rules and plastic synaptic devices.
