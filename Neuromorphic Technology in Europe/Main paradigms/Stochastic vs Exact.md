Stochastic computing utilizes approximate values and random number generation to perform calculations, reducing the need for high-precision components, and enabling more nuanced applications through approximation and optimization of error.

	"Resilience to such imprecision seems to be a key asset of neural networks. Relaxing the constraints on the exactitude of components and computing steps in order to decrease energy consumption while maintaining accurate results is a goal of neuromorphic technologies."


By relaxing exactness constraints in neuromorphic systems, energy efficiency can be improved while maintaining accurate results.
