Broad class of devices whose resistance can be modified by electrical stimuli. They can be used to implement synapses with the ability to update their states given new information (learning, plasticity) and to store analogue information (memory).

They can also be used to implement neurons with the stochastic, volatile and non-linear properties of biological neurons. 

Existing devices: RRAM, PCM, FeRAM and spin-transfer torque MRAM.
