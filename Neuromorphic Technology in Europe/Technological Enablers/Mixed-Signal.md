Mixed-signal technology combines the advantages of analogue and digital circuits:
- **Low power consumption:** Mixed-signal circuits only dissipate power when data is present.
- **Robustness and low latency:** Mixed-signal circuits are event-based and asynchronous, which makes them robust and low-latency.
- **Ability to process data on-line:** Mixed-signal circuits can process data as it is sensed or streamed through the system, without the need to store data or state variables in memory.

This technology enables the development of ==**sub-mW, always-on, real-time**== processing of sensory signals, which is essential for applications such as:
- [[Smart Agents on the Edge]]
- Personalized medicine
- Internet of Things
